- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @kg6-sleipnir

I am a college student on my way to get my AA degree, then a bachelors in the computer science field.
For fun, I like to teach myself about programming techniques and am currently learning about machine learning.

So far, I have created several machine learning algorithms from scratch using only the C++ standard library,
including linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, and conditional random fields.
My goal with this project is to create my own AI chatbot that I can hold a conversation with.
You can track my progress in my Widget repository.

I also make some other small projects such as Conway's Game of Life and a Sudoku board creator, both created in C.

My favorite programming language is C++ due to my knowledge on how it works. While most of my programming knowledge comes
from C++, I pride myself on being able to quickly and effectively learn new languages as I code with them.
For example, before starting on my chatbot, I knew nothing about C++ and forced myself to learn the language as I made progress.
