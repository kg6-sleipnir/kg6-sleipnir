AI/ML enthusiast and advocate for emoticons instead of emojis

I am currently a college student aiming for a Computer Science degree and
have a passion for AI/ML projects. 

I started my programming journey by forcing myself to create machine learning
algorithms using only the C++ standard library without any prior knowledge of
any of the C languages or machine learning. Through the careful reading and
application of research papers, I managed to create several ML models from
scratch. Some of the models I created include: logistic regression, linear
regression, decision trees, and conditional random fields. Using some of these
models, I have been able to create a system that can predict a word's part of
speech using context from surrounding words in a sentence. This system achieved
accuracies similar to those using models from public libraries such as
Scikit-learn in Python and is what I consider to be one of my greatest
achievements.

The original goal of my ML project was to create a chatbot program that I could
have a full conversation with. As this was the first real project I ever
started, the quality of my code was not what it is today. Nonetheless, the
original code can still be seen in my [Widget repository.](https://github.com/kg6-sleipnir/Widget/tree/master/Widget/Machine%20Learning)
With the recently emerging field of LLMs, I now know that if I were to complete
this project with my original goals, it would have taken hundreds of thousands
of dollars worth of GPUs months worth of time just to train the model. Safe to
say my little 2060 is not going to cut it (even if it's overclocked :P).
