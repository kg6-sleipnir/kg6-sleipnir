- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @kg6-sleipnir

I am currently a college student aiming for a Computer Science degree and sometimes make small projects just for the heck of it. 

I gained most of my programming knowledge by forcing myself to create machine learning and algorithms using only the C++ standard library without any prior knowledge of any of the C languages or machine learning.

The original goal of the project was to create a chatbot program that I could have a full conversation with. However, it has been awhile since I have touched the project.
Although the passion for this project is no longer what it once was, I did manage to create several machine learning algorithms with accuracies comparable to public machine learning libraries. Some of these algorithms include: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and Conditional Random Fields. 
Some of these algorithms are able to be viewed in the [Widget](https://github.com/kg6-sleipnir/Widget/tree/master/Widget/Machine%20Learning) repository.
Even though I never finished this project, I am still glad I created what I did because it was a great learning experience.
